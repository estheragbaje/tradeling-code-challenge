# Tradeling Frontend Code Challenge Solution

This code works through the use of **React**, **TypeScript** and **Redux** to filter users, issues and repositories.

## The Task

There will be two input fields. The first is a search field for the user to type the text. While the other is a dropdown where user can either pick "Users", or "Repositories" to define the entities that they want to search.

When the user doesn't have any input or clears the input, the input fields should be shown in the middle of the page.

## The Approach

## The UI Design

The UI design for the Desktop, Tablet and Mobile screens were done in Figma

Here's the link to the design:
